a2p3g000000KysAAAS,i have really liked every interaction that i have had with paladina  however some of the things that were promised in the information meetings were not really true  we were told that there would be no charge for labs and that you would get your prescriptions filled for free   there are only certain labs that are free and i got charged for the other labs   i had labs drawn earlier in the year with the same insurance through lab core directly and it cost me nothing  so paladina actually cost me more  i asked about the prescriptions and was told that they have some medications but they only give out a starter dose on new prescriptions they order  we were told in the meetings that we would not need referrals to other specialties because the physicians at paladina can do those consults themselves  that is not true   i experienced a delay in care caused by them not having access to the ssm ehr   if this is the ssm direct care provider they should have access to the ehr and get notifications of results   chest xray done on a thursday at ssm   ready the same day   i had to call paladina because i had not heard anything on monday and they had to call ssm   seems that there should have been better follow through on this ,21-01-2020,8,SSM Health DirectCare Chesterfield,Chesterfield,MO,0.8883,Positive,Passive,1579545000.0

a2p1U000000Rt4HQAS,the nurses were great but the doctor seemed more interested in talking than listening  he seemed very interested in promoting himself   his services rather than being a healthcare teammate on my team  when i visited previously there was a temporary doctor  dr  udin  possibly odin  i believe  who was hands down fantastic  he listened to  my  story and asked relevant questions rather than making assumptions out loud the way dr  mccay did  other than the doctor  i was also set back by things out of my control  for example  somehow the doctors office had   patient profiles for me  none of them with my correct info  because of this i had a terrible time getting access to the online portal and viewing lab results  i was told the info was sent over from humana  which is fine  but there should have been a printout or something to look over   verify the info was correct  this delay was completely avoidable  overall  i would not recommend friend family to visit this office  as i am not someone who is uneducated looking for a doctor to boss me around  instead  i have worked in healthcare over     years and appreciate when a physician is knowledgeable to current healthcare practices and research rather than an outdated view  this is something i ve seen not just in this office but in many offices with older  white  american doctors  i do not feel they are properly trained in common sense things  such as the benefits of a vegetarian diet  one mention of my diet and dr  mccay stated it would be insufficient for pregnancy or otherwise due to low protein vit b  as demonstrated by my labs this was not at all true for me  as all labs were in normal range  it is assumptions like this that cause me to question anything the doctor says  as i find myself wondering if he is really up to date in his knowledge  specifically  on this issue  it was as if the doctor had no idea millions of people around the world have vegetarian diets and have had such for centuries ,13-10-2016,2,Louisville Humana West Health Center,Louisville,KY,0.0,Extreme,Detractor,1476297000.0

a2p1U000000RqBrQAK,i went with the hope of getting an x ray for my back pain  i was told it was muscular and should keep icing and applying heat and take tylenol  this pain has been since november  it dissipated somewhat this last month however after the doctor palpating the upper area  it flared up severely causing burning pain all the way through my arms  shoulders  entire upper back   i truly believe there is something impinging on a nerve since it burns and feels like the entire upper back is being ripped apart   i was given no x ray   this was my experience however others may not have the same issue  the doctor was very cordial  very attentive given the amount of issues i went in with   also  i went in because i have been having diaphragmatic spasms  perhaps  which also started when my back pain started exactly at the same time  this again was back in november  however two weeks ago  i began having some gastritis  the doctor prescribed proton inhibitor and said the gastritis is causing the diaphragmatic hiccupping  wretching  again  i believe there was too much information for her but i needed her to understand that the diaphragmatic problem began almost     months ago and the gastritis just within the last   weeks  i don t believe there is a correlation with my chronic issues versus my acute  otherwise  i hope to work more with this doctor  i believe she knows her stuff  i just really wish we had more time to discuss issues instead of always racing against the clock then not getting anything accomplished ,11-03-2019,6,Pueblo Fortino Boulevard Health Center,Pueblo,CO,0.0,Neutral,Detractor,1552242600.0
